## Design Process

I made the website with 2 different colours, green and white, which look simple and easy to the eye with an aim to make all content easy to read and understand. The website is mainly for those who want to prepare meals within a certain period of time (e.g. 20 minutes) or with specific filters to cater to their needs. Having said that, an example of a user who can use this website is a housewife who can make use of the variety of recipes available to prepare meals for her family members to enjoy.

- As a housewife, I want to search for a recipe that contains Pasta, so that I can prepare a meal with my son's favourite ingredient, Pasta.
- As a student, I wan to search for recipes that are easy to make, so that I can prepare a meal that does not consume much of my time.

Provide us insights about your design process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. 
These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory)
Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - Navigation bar, easy for users to navigate to the "Get Recipe" page to start finding their desired recipe.
- Feature 2 - Multiple forms available to be filled up to get a filtered list of recipe.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Dark mode
- The total cost of all ingredients needed to prepare the meal

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
    - Bootstrap is used to simplify the whole process of styling the website


## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
